Executive Summary
=========
Cover type

For this project, the object is to predict whether the cover type is
type1 or type2. Binary classifer is considered.
take two random sample from the whole dataset and build predictive
model on the two sample datasets. Use cross-validation for model
parameters tunning. Choices of model are: CARET, .... And the
prediction outcome are compared to the

It is identified that model A has the best outcome. And it is
advisable to use model A to predict the forest cover type.

Introduction
=========
wheher cover type can be predicted by data mining techniques and
comparision of a range of different classification models to pick the
best model based on AUC.

Audience

Methodology
=========
why classification?
classfication models are used to predict categorical response
variable.
